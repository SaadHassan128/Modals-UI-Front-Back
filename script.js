UI focuses on the visual aspects of a product, ensuring that the design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, while UX is concerned with the overall experience a user has when interacting with the product. A well-designed UI enhances the users journey, making it intuitive and engaging, while a thoughtful UX ensures that the product meets the users needs and exceeds their expectations. Together, they form the foundation of a product that is not only functional but also delightful to use.",
